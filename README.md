# CS576Final

# Frontend
  ### Views using Web
  ### Communication with backend
  ### Controls/Features
# Backend
### Pipeline
* Video query
* Multi-threads response to extract different features and compare
* Overall comparing strategy with dataset videos
* Response
### Goal
All feature extractions and comparison should be done within 5 seconds. The features need to be tested seperately to verify its accuracy (from human eyes). The dimensions of features shall be discussed later. Please write sample codes to setup and extract features and compare.
